  abstract = {Porosity defects in laser powder bed fusion processes are critical, particularly when initiated in the high laser energy density regime, known as the keyhole regime. In-situ understanding of melt-pool dynamics is essential, which can be achieved through high energy radiography techniques. However, these techniques are costly and time-consuming, prompting the need for high fidelity numerical models. This paper presents a numerical model aimed at studying the correlation between powder bed fusion process inputs and the formation of deep and narrow vapor depressions (keyholes) thereby revealing interesting aspects that are difficult if not impossible to identify using experimental setups. The model consists of two coupled components: a multi-phase, multi-physics model to solve melt pool dynamics and a high-performance ray tracing-based multi-reflection laser radiation model. The metal free surface predicted by the first model is input into the radiation model, which calculates the effective energy absorbed, resulting in a fully coupled simulation Results show good agreement with experimental benchmark data from dynamic x-ray radiography techniques, with maximum deviations of 11\% in average keyhole depths and 2 to 8\% in laser absorption time profile and final pores were successfully predicted. The investigation of the impact of maximal temperature spot on keyhole shape and dynamics, revealed distinct keyhole shapes categorized by average maximal temperature spot and uncovering a clear pattern behind pore-keyhole separation, leading to a better understanding of chaotic keyhole mode where pores are generated and pushed into the melt pool. The developed numerical model offers a cost-effective alternative to experimental techniques and can aid in optimizing process parameters to mitigate porosity defects in additive manufacturing.},

Advanced techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Augmented Reality (AR), and simulation-based models play key roles in developing intelligent and adaptable DTs in manufacturing processes. However, questions remain regarding scalability, the integration of high-quality data, and the computational power required for real-time applications in developing DTs. Understanding the current state of DTs in AM is essential to address these challenges and fully utilize their potential in advancing AM processes.

  abstract = {There has been significant development in metal additive manufacturing (MAM) technology over the past few decades, and considerable progress has been made in understanding how various processes and their parameters influence the properties of printed metallic parts. Despite this, the knowledge concerning its characteristics has been dispersed across a variety of publications and sources, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire field, especially for businesses interested in additive manufacturing (AM). In order to bridge this gap, periodic reviews encompassing state-of-the-art as the whole are necessary. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the essential features of MAM techniques based on the most recent scientific knowledge. It explores emerging research on four of the most significant technologies, including material extrusion (ME), binder jetting (BJ), powder bed fusion (PBF), and directed energy deposition (DED). As well as providing an outline of fundamental process characteristics, ongoing efforts to optimize them and current challenges, it also highlights gaps in understanding and future research and development needs. A significant feature of this review is the provision of substantial documentation regarding the mechanical properties of materials processed by a variety of commercial systems, including a variety of novel hybrid additive manufacturing (HAM) machines. This is accompanied by an investigation into the most recent works done to characterize the environmental impact along with a conceptual framework for improving the energy efficiency (EE) of the manufacturing process. As a result of reporting on both the characteristics of several MAM processes along with their sustainability features in one integrated article, it is anticipated that this information will serve as a valuable resource for both the academic and manufacturing communities to better appreciate and understand what differentiates MAM from traditional manufacturing (TM) processes, thus facilitating its future advancement and adoption.}

  abstract = {Over the past decade, significant research has focused on detecting abnormalities in metal laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing. Effective online monitoring systems are crucial for enhancing process stability, repeatability, and the quality of final components. Therefore, the development of in situ detection mechanisms has become essential for metal L-PBF systems, making efficient closed-loop control strategies to adjust process parameters in real time vital. This paper presents an overview of current in situ monitoring systems used in metal L-PBF, complemented by ex situ characterizations. It discusses in situ techniques employed in L-PBF and evaluates the applicability of commercial systems. The review covers optical, thermal, acoustic, and X-ray in situ methods, along with destructive and non-destructive ex situ methods like optical, Archimedes, and X-ray characterization techniques. Each technique is analyzed based on the sensor used for defect detection and the type or size of defects. Optical in situ monitoring primarily identifies large defects from powder bed abnormalities, while thermal methods detect defects as small as 100 µm and keyholes. Thermal in situ detection techniques are notable for their applicability to commercial devices and efficacy in detecting subsurface defects. Computed tomography scanning excels in locating porosity in 3D space with high accuracy. This study also explores the advantages of multi-sensor in situ techniques, such as combining optical and thermal sensors, and concludes by addressing current research needs and potential applications of multi-sensor systems.},

  abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) field is rapidly expanding, attracting significant scientific attention. This family of processes will be widely used in the evolution of Industry 4.0, particularly in the production of customized components. However, as the complexity and variability of additive manufacturing processes increase, there is an increasing need for advanced techniques to ensure quality control, optimize performance, and reduce production costs. Multiple tests are required to optimize processing variables for specific equipment and processes, to achieve optimum processing conditions. The application of digital twins (DTs) has significantly enhanced the field of additive manufacturing. A digital twin, abbreviated as DT, refers to a computer-generated model that accurately depicts a real-world object, system, or process. A DT comprises the complete additive manufacturing process, from the initial conception phase to the final manufacturing phase. It enables the manufacturing process to be continuously monitored, studied, and optimized in real time. DT has emerged as an important tool in the additive manufacturing industry. They allow manufacturers to enhance the process, improve product quality, decrease costs, and accelerate innovation. However, the development of DT in AM is an iterative and continuous process. It requires collaboration between domain experts, data scientists, engineers, and manufacturing teams to guarantee an accurate representation of the process by the digital twin. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of DT for additive manufacturing, examining their applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions.},

  abstract = {Low performance is considered one of the main drawbacks of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technology. In the present work, the effect of the AlSi10Mg powder layer thickness on the laser melting process was investigated to improve the LPBF building rate. A high-fidelity simulation of the melt pool formation was performed for different thicknesses of the powder bed using the Kintech Simulation Software for Additive Manufacturing (KiSSAM, version cd8e01d) developed by the authors. The powder bed after the recoating operation was obtained by the discrete element method. The laser energy deposition on the powder particles and the substrate was simulated by ray tracing. For the validation of the model, an experimental analysis of single tracks was performed on two types of substrates. The first substrate was manufactured directly with LPBF technology, while the second was cast. The simulation was carried out for various combinations of process parameters, predominantly with a high energy input, which provided a sufficient remelting depth. The calculations revealed the unstable keyhole mode appearance associated with the low absorptivity of the aluminum alloy at a scanning speed of 300 mm/s for all levels of the laser power (325–375 W). The results allowed formulating the criteria for the lack of fusion emerging during LPBF with an increased layer thickness. This work is expected to provide a scientific basis for the analysis of the maximum layer thickness via simulation to increase the performance of the technology.},

  abstract = {Early detection of defects, such as keyhole pores and cracks is crucial in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) additive manufacturing (AM) to prevent build failures. However, the complex melt pool behaviour cannot be adequately captured by conventional single-modal process monitoring approaches. This study introduces a multisensor fusion-based digital twin (MFDT) for localized quality prediction in the robotic L-DED process. The data used in multisensor fusion includes features extracted from a coaxial melt pool vision camera, a microphone, and an off-axis short wavelength infrared thermal camera. The key novelty of this work is a spatiotemporal data fusion method that synchronizes multisensor features with the real-time robot motion data to achieve localized quality prediction. Optical microscope (OM) images of the printed part are used to locate defect-free and defective regions (i.e., cracks and keyhole pores), which serve as ground truth labels for training supervised machine learning (ML) models for quality prediction. The trained ML model is then used to generate a virtual quality map that registers quality prediction outcomes within the 3D volume of the printed part, thus eliminating the need of physical inspections by destructive methods. Experiments show that the virtual quality map closely matches the actual quality observed by OM. Compared to traditional single-sensor-based quality prediction, the MFDT has achieved a significantly higher quality prediction accuracy (96\%), a higher ROC-AUC score (99\%), and a lower false alarm rate (4.4\%). As a result, the MFDT is a more reliable method for defect prediction. The proposed MFDT also lays the groundwork for our future development of a self-adaptive hybrid processing strategy that combines machining with AM for defect removal and quality improvement.},

  abstract = {Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%--30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to Proportional--Integral--Derivative (PID) controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) technology is a new trend in manufacturing complex geometric structures from metals. This technology allows producing topologically optimized parts for aerospace, medical and industrial sectors where a high performance-to-weight ratio is required. Commonly the feature size for such applications is higher than 300–400 microns. However, for several possible applications of LPBF technology, for example, microfluidic devices, stents for coronary vessels, porous filters, dentistry, etc., a significant increase in the resolution is required. This work is aimed to study the resolution factors of LPBF technology for the manufacturing of superelastic instruments for endodontic treatment, namely Self-Adjusting Files (SAF). Samples of thin walls with different incline angles and SAF samples were manufactured from Nickel-Titanium pre-alloyed powder with a 15–45 μm fraction. The printing procedure was done using an LPBF set-up equipped with a conventional ytterbium fiber laser with a nominal laser spot diameter of 55 microns. The results reveal physical, apparatus, and software factors limiting the resolution of the LPBF technology. Additionally, XRD and DSC tests were done to study the effect of single track based scanning mode manufacturing on the phase composition and phase transformation temperatures. Found combination of optimal process parameters including laser power of 100 W, scanning speed of 850 mm/s, and layer thickness of 20 μm was suitable for manufacturing SAF files with the required resolution. The results will be helpful for the production of NiTi micro objects based on periodic structures both by the LPBF and μLPBF methods.},

A vertical spreader blade was used to accelerate a powder heap across a horizontal surface, with a thin gap between the blade and the surface, resulting in the deposition of a thin powder layer. The results showed that it is inevitable to deposit a powder layer with a lower packing fraction than the initial powder heap due to three mechanisms: shear-induced dilation during the initiation of powder motion by the spreader; dilation and rearrangement due to powder motion through the gap; and the inertia of the particles in the deposited powder layer. It was shown that the process conditions control the contribution of these three mechanisms, and that the velocity profile in the shear layer in front of the gap is critical to the final deposited layer packing fraction. The higher the mean normalised velocity in the shear layer the lower the deposited layer packing fraction. The gap thickness and the spreader blade velocity affect the properties of the deposited layer; with the former increasing its packing fraction and the latter decreasing it. The analysis presented in this study could be adapted to powders of different materials, morphologies and surface properties.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The digital twin (DT) is a relatively new concept that is finding increased acceptance in industry. A DT is generally considered as comprising a physical entity, its virtual replica, and two-way digital data communications in-between. Its primary purpose is to leverage the process intelligence captured within digital models---or usually their faster-solving surrogates---towards generating increased value from the physical entities. The surrogate models are created using machine learning based on data obtained from the field, experiments and digital models, which may be physics-based or statistics-based. Anomaly detection and correction, and diagnostic closed-loop process control are examples of how a process DT can be deployed. In the manufacturing industry, its use can achieve improvements in product quality and process productivity. Metal additive manufacturing (AM) stands to gain tremendously from the use of DTs. This is because the AM process is inherently chaotic, resulting in poor repeatability. However, a DT acting in a supervisory role can inject certainty into the process by actively keeping it within bounds through real-time control commands. Closed-loop feedforward control is achieved by observing the process through sensors that monitor critical parameters and, if there are any deviations from their respective optimal ranges, suitable corrective actions are triggered. The type of corrective action (e.g. a change in laser power or a modification to the scanning speed) and its magnitude are determined by interrogating the surrogate models. Because of their artificial intelligence (AI)-endowed predictive capabilities, which allow them to foresee a future state of the physical twin (e.g. the AM process), DTs proactively take context-sensitive preventative steps, whereas traditional closed-loop feedback control is usually reactive. Apart from assisting a build process in real-time, a DT can help with planning the build of a part by pinpointing the optimum processing window relevant to the desired outcome. Again, the surrogate models are consulted to obtain the required information. In this article, we explain how the application of DTs to the metal AM process can significantly widen its application space by making the process more repeatable (through quality assurance) and cheaper (by getting builds right the first time).}

  abstract = {The ramp-up of new geometries, process parameters, and materials can be enormously time and cost-intensive in Additive Manufacturing. Especially for Laser-Directed Energy Deposition (DED-L), the extreme physical environment at the melt pool results in the need for multiple trial-and-error tests to quantify the process behavior. These tests significantly raise manufacturing expenses. A Digital Twin (DT) of the DED-L process can therefore be of substantial value if the amount of experimental testing is hereby reduced. In the present study, a multiscale DT based on coupling a global and local model has been investigated. The global model simulates the heating of the entire part, whereas the local model represents only a specific region of this global geometry. Using a high-density mesh for the local model enables the simulation of the specific laser-powder interactions and fast-cooling rates typical in DED-L. The results of the global model are used to integrate context awareness about the changing process conditions during the print job into the local model. This process evolvement is impossible to obtain with models of smaller dimensions and is of elemental necessity for accurately simulating multi-clad depositions. The DT was validated on an industrial-grade DED-L machine with in-situ process monitoring capabilities. In all cases, the DT shows a high resemblance with the experimental data and metallographic inspections at a reasonable computational cost.},

  abstract = {Despite the significant advances made involving the additive manufacturing (AM) of metals, including those related to both materials and processes, challenges remain in regard to the rapid qualification and insertion of such materials into applications. In general, understanding the process–microstructure–property interrelationships is essential. To successfully understand these interrelationships on a process-by-process basis and exploit such knowledge in practice, leveraging monitoring, modeling, and statistical analysis is necessary. Monitoring allows for the identification and measurement of parameters and features associated with important physical processes that may vary spatially and temporally during the AM processes that will influence part properties, including spatial variations within a single part and part-to-part variability, and, ultimately, quality. Modeling allows for the prediction of physical processes, material states, and properties of future builds by creating material state abstractions that can then be tested or evolved virtually. Statistical analysis permits the data from monitoring to inform modeling, and vice versa, under the added consideration that physical measurements and mathematical abstractions contain uncertainties. Throughout this review, the feedstock, energy source, melt pool, defects, compositional distribution, microstructure, texture, residual stresses, and mechanical properties are examined from the points of view of monitoring, modeling, and statistical analysis. As with most active research subjects, there remain both possibilities and limitations, and these will be considered and discussed as appropriate.},

  abstract = {Laser directed-energy deposition (DED) offers notable advantages in additive manufacturing (AM) for producing intricate geometries and facilitating material functional grading. However, inherent challenges such as material property inconsistencies and part variability persist, predominantly due to its layer-wise fabrication approach. Critical to these challenges is heat accumulation during DED, influencing the resultant material microstructure and properties. Although closed-loop control methods for managing heat accumulation and temperature regulation are prevalent in DED literature, few approaches integrate real-time monitoring, physics-based modeling, and control simultaneously in a cohesive framework. To address this, we present a digital twin (DT) framework for real-time model predictive control of process parameters of the DED for achieving a specific process design objective. To enable its implementation, we detail the development of a surrogate model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based machine learning which uses Bayesian Inference to predict temperatures across various spatial locations of the DED-built part. This model offers real-time predictions of future temperature states. In addition, we introduce a Bayesian Optimization (BO) method for Time Series Process Optimization (BOTSPO). Its foundational principles align with traditional BO, and its novelty lies in our unique time series process profile generator with a reduced dimensional representation. BOTSPO is used for dynamic process optimization in which we deploy BOTSPO to determine the optimal laser power profile, aiming to achieve desired mechanical properties in a DED build. The identified profile establishes a process trajectory that online process optimizations aim to match or exceed in performance. This paper elucidates components of the digital twin framework, advocating its prospective consolidation into a comprehensive digital twin system for AM.},

A three-dimensional high fidelity powder-scale model reveals how the strong dynamical melt flow generates pore defects, material spattering (sparking), and denudation zones. The melt track is divided into three sections: a topological depression, a transition and a tail region, each being the location of specific physical effects. The inclusion of laser ray-tracing energy deposition in the powder-scale model improves over traditional volumetric energy deposition. It enables partial particle melting, which impacts pore defects in the denudation zone. Different pore formation mechanisms are observed at the edge of a scan track, at the melt pool bottom (during collapse of the pool depression), and at the end of the melt track (during laser power ramp down). Remedies to these undesirable pores are discussed. The results are validated against the experiments and the sensitivity to laser absorptivity is discussed.},

  abstract = {A digital twin (DT), with the components of a physics-based model, a data-driven model, and a machine learning (ML) enabled efficient surrogate model, behaves as a virtual twin of the real-world physical process. In terms of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) based additive manufacturing (AM), a DT can predict the current and future states of the melt pool and the resulting defects corresponding to the input laser parameters, evolve itself by assimilating in-situ sensor data, and optimize the laser parameters to mitigate defect formation. In this paper, we present a deep neural operator enabled DT framework for closed-loop feedback control of the L-PBF process. This is accomplished by building a physics-based computational model to accurately represent the melt pool states, an efficient Fourier neural operator (FNO) based surrogate model to approximate the melt pool solution field, followed by a physics-based procedure to extract information from the computed melt pool simulation that can further be correlated to the defect quantities of interest (e.g., surface roughness). An optimization algorithm is then exercised to control laser input and minimize defects. On the other hand, the constructed DT also evolves with the physical twin via offline finetuning and online material calibration. For instance, the probabilistic distribution of laser absorptivity can be updated to match the real-time captured thermal image data. Finally, a probabilistic framework is adopted for uncertainty quantification. The developed DT is envisioned to guide the AM process and facilitate high-quality manufacturing in L-PBF-based metal AM.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The purpose of this research is to enhance the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing technique by addressing its susceptibility to defects, specifically lack of fusion. The primary goal is to optimize the LPBF process using a digital twin (DT) approach, integrating physics-based modeling and machine learning to predict the lack of fusion.                                         Design/methodology/approach               This research uses finite element modeling to simulate the physics of LPBF for an AISI 316L stainless steel alloy. Various process parameters are systematically varied to generate a comprehensive data set that captures the relationship between factors such as power and scan speed and the quality of fusion. A novel DT architecture is proposed, combining a classification model (recurrent neural network) with reinforcement learning. This DT model leverages real-time sensor data to predict the lack of fusion and adjusts process parameters through the reinforcement learning system, ensuring the system remains within a controllable zone.                                         Findings               This study's findings reveal that the proposed DT approach successfully predicts and mitigates the lack of fusion in the LPBF process. By using a combination of physics-based modeling and machine learning, the research establishes an efficient framework for optimizing fusion in metal LPBF processes. The DT's ability to adapt and control parameters in real time, guided by machine learning predictions, provides a promising solution to the challenges associated with lack of fusion, potentially overcoming the traditional and costly trial-and-error experimental approach.                                         Originality/value               Originality lies in the development of a novel DT architecture that integrates physics-based modeling with machine learning techniques, specifically a recurrent neural network and reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {Powder Bed Additive Manufacturing offers unique advantages in terms of manufacturing cost, lot size, and product complexity compared to traditional processes such as casting, where a minimum lot size is mandatory to achieve economic competitiveness. Many studies—both experimental and numerical—are dedicated to the analysis of how process parameters such as heat source power, scan speed, and scan strategy affect the final material properties. Apart from the general urge to increase the build rate using thicker powder layers, the coating process and how the powder is distributed on the processing table has received very little attention to date. This paper focuses on the first step of every powder bed build process: Coating the process table. A numerical study is performed to investigate how powder is transferred from the source to the processing table. A solid coating blade is modeled to spread commercial Ti-6Al-4V powder. The resulting powder layer is analyzed statistically to determine the packing density and its variation across the processing table. The results are compared with literature reports using the so-called “rain” models. A parameter study is performed to identify the influence of process table displacement and wiper velocity on the powder distribution. The achieved packing density and how that affects subsequent heat source interaction with the powder bed is also investigated numerically.},

  abstract = {The customized production of complex components by 3D printing has been hailed as a potentially transformative tool in manufacturing with important applications in health care, automotive and aerospace industries. However, after about a quarter of a century of research and development, only a handful of commercial alloys can be printed and the market value of all 3D printed products now amounts to a negligible portion of the manufacturing economy. This difficulty is attributable to a remarkable diversity in structure and properties of the printed components and susceptibility to defects. In addition, the current practice of qualifying components by prolonged trial and error with expensive printing equipment and feed stock material confine the printed products to a niche market where the high product cost and the delay in the qualification are not critical factors. Here we explain how a digital twin or a digital replica of the printing machine will reduce the number of trial and error tests to obtain desired product attributes and reduce the time required for part qualification to make the printed components cost effective. It is shown that a comprehensive digital twin of 3D printing machine consisting of mechanistic, control and statistical models of 3D printing, machine learning and big data can reduce the volume of trial and error testing, reduce defects and shorten time between the design and production.},

The as-fabricated samples were investigated using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The interaction between laser beam and powder particles was studied by both high speed imaging observation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculation. It was found that at a high laser power and a fixed powder layer thickness (20μm), the samples contain particularly low porosity when the laser scanning speeds are below 2700mm/s. Further increase of scanning speed led to increase of porosity but not significantly. The porosity is even more sensitive to powder layer thickness with the use of thick powder layers (above 40μm) leading to significant porosity. The increase of porosity with laser scanning speed and powder layer thickness is not inconsistent with the observed increase in surface roughness complicated by increasingly irregular-shaped laser scanned tracks and an increased number of discontinuity and cave-like pores on the top surfaces. The formation of pores and development of rough surfaces were found by both high speed imaging and modelling, to be strongly associated with unstable melt flow and splashing of molten material.},

In such context, a clear need emerges to study laser-matter interaction regarding the persisting questions surrounding the comprehension of melt pool. An experimental campaign involving thin pillars made of the nickel-based superalloy IN718 is presented, highlighting the complexity introduced by the thin tracks superposition. Then, a continuous mesoscale numerical model, considering heat transfer, melt pool flow, and vaporization phenomena, and its extension to multilayer-multitrack simulation is detailed. Some discussions about the numerical approach and its ability to predict the global morphology and dimensions of melt pool zones and resulting tracks after solidification are proposed. Finally, comparisons between the experiments and the numerical model show good agreement, with a maximum relative error of 8\,\% observed for remelted zone depth. This study demonstrates the capability of the present approach to help in understanding the influence of process parameters on melt pool shape and, thereafter, to determine process parameters to optimize for lattice features building.},

  abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes enable their deployment in broad applications from aerospace to art, design, and architecture. Part quality and performance are the main concerns during AM processes execution that the achievement of adequate characteristics can be guaranteed, considering a wide range of influencing factors, such as process parameters, material, environment, measurement, and operators training. Investigating the effects of not only the influential AM processes variables but also their interactions and coupled impacts are essential to process optimization which requires huge efforts to be made. Therefore, numerical simulation can be an effective tool that facilities the evaluation of the AM processes principles. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a widespread Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM process that due to its superior advantages, such as capability to print complex and highly customized components, which leads to an increasing attention paid by industries and academia. Temperature distribution and melt pool dynamics have paramount importance to be well simulated and correlated by part quality in terms of surface finish, induced residual stress and microstructure evolution during SLM. Summarizing numerical simulations of SLM in this survey is pointed out as one important research perspective as well as exploring the contribution of adopted approaches and practices. This review survey has been organized to give an overview of AM processes such as extrusion, photopolymerization, material jetting, laminated object manufacturing, and powder bed fusion. And in particular is targeted to discuss the conducted numerical simulation of SLM to illustrate a uniform picture of existing nonproprietary approaches to predict the heat transfer, melt pool behavior, microstructure and residual stresses analysis.},

To address this challenge, the study applies a novel approach named retrieval augmented generation. This is a technique that combines large language models with real-time information retrieval, enabling the automated identification and summarization of typologies across a broad corpus of publications. A total of 1,354 publications were initially screened, leading to 144 distinct categorizations relevant to digital twins in industrial contexts. The resulting taxonomy classifies digital twins along multiple dimensions, including life cycle stages, physical domain and hierarchy levels, model characteristics, digital thread connectivity and deployment strategies. This work provides both researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to understanding and implementing digital twins in manufacturing environments, as well as a guideline to completely describe a specific implementation. The taxonomy serves as a foundation for future research and as a practical tool for industrial applications, since it defines design decisions, which have to be made.},

Conceptually, a DT mimics the state of its physical twin in real time and vice versa. Application of DT includes real-time monitoring, designing/planning, optimization, maintenance, remote access, etc. Its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades. The advent of Industry 4.0 has brought complex industrial systems that are more autonomous, smart, and highly interconnected. These systems generate considerable amounts of data useful for several applications such as improving performance, predictive maintenance, training, etc. A sudden influx in the number of publications related to ‘Digital Twin’ has led to confusion between different terminologies related to the digitalization of industries. Another problem that has arisen due to the growing popularity of DT is a lack of consensus on the description of DT as well as so many different types of DT, which adds to the confusion. This paper intends to consolidate the different types of DT and different definitions of DT throughout the literature for easy identification of DT from the rest of the complimentary terms such as ‘product avatar’, ‘digital thread’, ‘digital model’, and ‘digital shadow’. The paper looks at the concept of DT since its inception to its predicted future to realize the value it can bring to certain sectors. Understanding the characteristics and types of DT while weighing its pros and cons is essential for any researcher, business, or sector before investing in the technology.}

The principal goal of this study is to highlight the aspects of DF and its development using existing techniques.A comprehensive literature review finds a substantial lack of complete techniques that incorporate cyber-physical systems, advanced data analytics, AI, standardized interoperability, human--machine cooperation and scalable adaptability. The suggested DF effectively fills this void by integrating cyber-physical system components, including DT, AM, SM and sensors into the manufacturing process. Using sophisticated data analytics and AI algorithms, the DF facilitates real-time data analysis, predictive maintenance, quality control and optimal resource allocation. In addition, the suggested DF ensures interoperability between diverse devices and systems by emphasizing standardized communication protocols and interfaces. The modular and adaptable architecture of the DF enables scalability and adaptation, allowing for rapid reaction to market conditions.Based on the need of DF, this review presents a comprehensive approach to DF development using DTs, sensing devices, LAM and SM processes and provides current progress in this domain.}

The results outline the challenges associated with data collection and processing due to real-time requirements or generating relevant data through sensors.

Standard engineering tools used for DTs in the literature are not employed in the AM context. Many studies present generic implementations for DTs that do not address the required level of detail to achieve an effective DT solution.

In details, a mesoscopic model is developed by millimeter-scale voids, where the material properties derived from homogenization calculations of a micro-scale model containing voids, fibers, and resins. Comparing against theoretical calculations and conventional representative volume element methods demonstrates that the proposed multi-scale approach offers higher accuracy in predicting the mechanical behavior of carbon fiber reinforced polymers with voids (the error within 5\% of experimental results).

  abstract = {With the development of Industry 4.0, additive manufacturing will be widely used to produce customized components. However, it is rather time-consuming and expensive to produce components with sound structure and good mechanical properties using additive manufacturing by a trial-and-error approach. To obtain optimal process conditions, numerous experiments are needed to optimize the process variables within given machines and processes. Digital twins (DT) are defined as a digital representation of a production system or service or just an active unique product characterized by certain properties or conditions. They are the potential solution to assist in overcoming many issues in additive manufacturing, in order to improve part quality and shorten the time to qualify products. The DT system could be very helpful to understand, analyze and improve the product, service system or production. However, the development of genuine DT is still impeded due to lots of factors, such as the lack of a thorough understanding of the DT concept, framework, and development methods. Moreover, the linkage between existing brownfield systems and their data are under development. This paper aims to summarize the current status and issues in DT for additive manufacturing, in order to provide more references for subsequent research on DT systems.},

  abstract = {Biomass‐based hydrogel is a promising flame‐retardant material and has a high potential for applications in transportation, aerospace, building and electrical engineering, and electronics. However, rapid vat photopolymerization (VP) 3D printing of biomass‐based hydrogels, especially that of all‐natural ones, is still rare. Herein, a new class of VP 3D‐printed hydrogels with strong covalent networks, fabricating using fully biomass materials and a commercial liquid crystal display (LCD) printer assembled with low‐intensity visible light is presented. Encouragingly, the highly ordered layer‐by‐layer packing structures provided by VP 3D printing technology endow these hydrogels with remarkable flame retardancy, exceptional temperature resistance, advantageous combustion behaviors, and favorable mechanical strength, in particular, giving them a better limit oxygen index (83.5\%) than various biomass‐based hydrogels. The proposed approach enables the green design as well as the precise and efficient preparation for flame‐retardant materials, paving the way for the future flame‐retardant materials toward attaining green sustainability.}

            This paper investigates the potential of the discrete element method to simulate the physics of particle bed-based additive manufacturing. This method naturally captures the discrete aspects of additive manufacturing processes, such as material addition. The proposed discrete element framework uses constitutive relations for loose powder, bonding kinematics and the thermo-mechanical behaviour of bonded particles. The mechanical bond interactions consist of beams that interconnect the particles. These beams are able to transfer forces as well as moments. The thermal conductive bond interactions assume an effective conductive area and density to account for the voids in the system. Simulated compression tests reveal that the macroscopic Youngâ€™s modulus and Poissonâ€™s ratio of the bonded material are controlled by only two micro-scale parameters. Furthermore, a heat conducting rod of both powder and bonded material is simulated and compared to a continuum finite element simulation. The proposed discrete model is able to simulate a complete printing process, capturing the solid material behaviour accurately. A simulation of a printed sample shows various additive manufacturing aspects such as: the deposited powder layer, G-code input, heat source interaction, contact, bonding, thermal conduction and the accumulation of residual stresses and deformations.},
