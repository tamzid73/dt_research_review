Advanced techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Augmented Reality (AR), and simulation-based models play key roles in developing intelligent and adaptable DTs in manufacturing processes. However, questions remain regarding scalability, the integration of high-quality data, and the computational power required for real-time applications in developing DTs. Understanding the current state of DTs in AM is essential to address these challenges and fully utilize their potential in advancing AM processes. Considering this opportunity, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of DTs in AM by addressing the following four research questions: (1) What are the key types of DTs used in AM and their specific applications? (2) What are the recent developments and implementations of DTs? (3) How are DTs employed in process improvement and hybrid manufacturing? (4) How are DTs integrated with Industry 4.0 technologies?

  abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) field is rapidly expanding, attracting significant scientific attention. This family of processes will be widely used in the evolution of Industry 4.0, particularly in the production of customized components. However, as the complexity and variability of additive manufacturing processes increase, there is an increasing need for advanced techniques to ensure quality control, optimize performance, and reduce production costs. Multiple tests are required to optimize processing variables for specific equipment and processes, to achieve optimum processing conditions. The application of digital twins (DTs) has significantly enhanced the field of additive manufacturing. A digital twin, abbreviated as DT, refers to a computer-generated model that accurately depicts a real-world object, system, or process. A DT comprises the complete additive manufacturing process, from the initial conception phase to the final manufacturing phase. It enables the manufacturing process to be continuously monitored, studied, and optimized in real time. DT has emerged as an important tool in the additive manufacturing industry. They allow manufacturers to enhance the process, improve product quality, decrease costs, and accelerate innovation. However, the development of DT in AM is an iterative and continuous process. It requires collaboration between domain experts, data scientists, engineers, and manufacturing teams to guarantee an accurate representation of the process by the digital twin. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of DT for additive manufacturing, examining their applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions.},

  abstract = {Early detection of defects, such as keyhole pores and cracks is crucial in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) additive manufacturing (AM) to prevent build failures. However, the complex melt pool behaviour cannot be adequately captured by conventional single-modal process monitoring approaches. This study introduces a multisensor fusion-based digital twin (MFDT) for localized quality prediction in the robotic L-DED process. The data used in multisensor fusion includes features extracted from a coaxial melt pool vision camera, a microphone, and an off-axis short wavelength infrared thermal camera. The key novelty of this work is a spatiotemporal data fusion method that synchronizes multisensor features with the real-time robot motion data to achieve localized quality prediction. Optical microscope (OM) images of the printed part are used to locate defect-free and defective regions (i.e., cracks and keyhole pores), which serve as ground truth labels for training supervised machine learning (ML) models for quality prediction. The trained ML model is then used to generate a virtual quality map that registers quality prediction outcomes within the 3D volume of the printed part, thus eliminating the need of physical inspections by destructive methods. Experiments show that the virtual quality map closely matches the actual quality observed by OM. Compared to traditional single-sensor-based quality prediction, the MFDT has achieved a significantly higher quality prediction accuracy (96\%), a higher ROC-AUC score (99\%), and a lower false alarm rate (4.4\%). As a result, the MFDT is a more reliable method for defect prediction. The proposed MFDT also lays the groundwork for our future development of a self-adaptive hybrid processing strategy that combines machining with AM for defect removal and quality improvement.},

  abstract = {Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%--30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to Proportional--Integral--Derivative (PID) controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The digital twin (DT) is a relatively new concept that is finding increased acceptance in industry. A DT is generally considered as comprising a physical entity, its virtual replica, and two-way digital data communications in-between. Its primary purpose is to leverage the process intelligence captured within digital models---or usually their faster-solving surrogates---towards generating increased value from the physical entities. The surrogate models are created using machine learning based on data obtained from the field, experiments and digital models, which may be physics-based or statistics-based. Anomaly detection and correction, and diagnostic closed-loop process control are examples of how a process DT can be deployed. In the manufacturing industry, its use can achieve improvements in product quality and process productivity. Metal additive manufacturing (AM) stands to gain tremendously from the use of DTs. This is because the AM process is inherently chaotic, resulting in poor repeatability. However, a DT acting in a supervisory role can inject certainty into the process by actively keeping it within bounds through real-time control commands. Closed-loop feedforward control is achieved by observing the process through sensors that monitor critical parameters and, if there are any deviations from their respective optimal ranges, suitable corrective actions are triggered. The type of corrective action (e.g. a change in laser power or a modification to the scanning speed) and its magnitude are determined by interrogating the surrogate models. Because of their artificial intelligence (AI)-endowed predictive capabilities, which allow them to foresee a future state of the physical twin (e.g. the AM process), DTs proactively take context-sensitive preventative steps, whereas traditional closed-loop feedback control is usually reactive. Apart from assisting a build process in real-time, a DT can help with planning the build of a part by pinpointing the optimum processing window relevant to the desired outcome. Again, the surrogate models are consulted to obtain the required information. In this article, we explain how the application of DTs to the metal AM process can significantly widen its application space by making the process more repeatable (through quality assurance) and cheaper (by getting builds right the first time).}

  abstract = {The ramp-up of new geometries, process parameters, and materials can be enormously time and cost-intensive in Additive Manufacturing. Especially for Laser-Directed Energy Deposition (DED-L), the extreme physical environment at the melt pool results in the need for multiple trial-and-error tests to quantify the process behavior. These tests significantly raise manufacturing expenses. A Digital Twin (DT) of the DED-L process can therefore be of substantial value if the amount of experimental testing is hereby reduced. In the present study, a multiscale DT based on coupling a global and local model has been investigated. The global model simulates the heating of the entire part, whereas the local model represents only a specific region of this global geometry. Using a high-density mesh for the local model enables the simulation of the specific laser-powder interactions and fast-cooling rates typical in DED-L. The results of the global model are used to integrate context awareness about the changing process conditions during the print job into the local model. This process evolvement is impossible to obtain with models of smaller dimensions and is of elemental necessity for accurately simulating multi-clad depositions. The DT was validated on an industrial-grade DED-L machine with in-situ process monitoring capabilities. In all cases, the DT shows a high resemblance with the experimental data and metallographic inspections at a reasonable computational cost.},

  abstract = {Laser directed-energy deposition (DED) offers notable advantages in additive manufacturing (AM) for producing intricate geometries and facilitating material functional grading. However, inherent challenges such as material property inconsistencies and part variability persist, predominantly due to its layer-wise fabrication approach. Critical to these challenges is heat accumulation during DED, influencing the resultant material microstructure and properties. Although closed-loop control methods for managing heat accumulation and temperature regulation are prevalent in DED literature, few approaches integrate real-time monitoring, physics-based modeling, and control simultaneously in a cohesive framework. To address this, we present a digital twin (DT) framework for real-time model predictive control of process parameters of the DED for achieving a specific process design objective. To enable its implementation, we detail the development of a surrogate model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based machine learning which uses Bayesian Inference to predict temperatures across various spatial locations of the DED-built part. This model offers real-time predictions of future temperature states. In addition, we introduce a Bayesian Optimization (BO) method for Time Series Process Optimization (BOTSPO). Its foundational principles align with traditional BO, and its novelty lies in our unique time series process profile generator with a reduced dimensional representation. BOTSPO is used for dynamic process optimization in which we deploy BOTSPO to determine the optimal laser power profile, aiming to achieve desired mechanical properties in a DED build. The identified profile establishes a process trajectory that online process optimizations aim to match or exceed in performance. This paper elucidates components of the digital twin framework, advocating its prospective consolidation into a comprehensive digital twin system for AM.},

In terms of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) based additive manufacturing (AM), a DT can predict the current and future states of the melt pool and the resulting defects corresponding to the input laser parameters, evolve itself by assimilating in-situ sensor data, and optimize the laser parameters to mitigate defect formation. In this paper, we present a deep neural operator enabled DT framework for closed-loop feedback control of the L-PBF process. This is accomplished by building a physics-based computational model to accurately represent the melt pool states, an efficient Fourier neural operator (FNO) based surrogate model to approximate the melt pool solution field, followed by a physics-based procedure to extract information from the computed melt pool simulation that can further be correlated to the defect quantities of interest (e.g., surface roughness). An optimization algorithm is then exercised to control laser input and minimize defects. On the other hand, the constructed DT also evolves with the physical twin via offline finetuning and online material calibration. For instance, the probabilistic distribution of laser absorptivity can be updated to match the real-time captured thermal image data. Finally, a probabilistic framework is adopted for uncertainty quantification. The developed DT is envisioned to guide the AM process and facilitate high-quality manufacturing in L-PBF-based metal AM.},

  abstract = {With the development of Industry 4.0, additive manufacturing will be widely used to produce customized components. However, it is rather time-consuming and expensive to produce components with sound structure and good mechanical properties using additive manufacturing by a trial-and-error approach. To obtain optimal process conditions, numerous experiments are needed to optimize the process variables within given machines and processes. Digital twins (DT) are defined as a digital representation of a production system or service or just an active unique product characterized by certain properties or conditions. They are the potential solution to assist in overcoming many issues in additive manufacturing, in order to improve part quality and shorten the time to qualify products. The DT system could be very helpful to understand, analyze and improve the product, service system or production. However, the development of genuine DT is still impeded due to lots of factors, such as the lack of a thorough understanding of the DT concept, framework, and development methods. Moreover, the linkage between existing brownfield systems and their data are under development. This paper aims to summarize the current status and issues in DT for additive manufacturing, in order to provide more references for subsequent research on DT systems.},
