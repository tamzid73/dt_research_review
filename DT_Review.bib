  abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) are becoming popular in Additive Manufacturing (AM) due to their ability to create virtual replicas of physical components of AM machines, which helps in real-time production monitoring. Advanced techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), Augmented Reality (AR), and simulation-based models play key roles in developing intelligent and adaptable DTs in manufacturing processes. However, questions remain regarding scalability, the integration of high-quality data, and the computational power required for real-time applications in developing DTs. Understanding the current state of DTs in AM is essential to address these challenges and fully utilize their potential in advancing AM processes. Considering this opportunity, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of DTs in AM by addressing the following four research questions: (1) What are the key types of DTs used in AM and their specific applications? (2) What are the recent developments and implementations of DTs? (3) How are DTs employed in process improvement and hybrid manufacturing? (4) How are DTs integrated with Industry 4.0 technologies?

  abstract = {There has been significant development in metal additive manufacturing (MAM) technology over the past few decades, and considerable progress has been made in understanding how various processes and their parameters influence the properties of printed metallic parts. Despite this, the knowledge concerning its characteristics has been dispersed across a variety of publications and sources, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire field, especially for businesses interested in additive manufacturing (AM). In order to bridge this gap, periodic reviews encompassing state-of-the-art as the whole are necessary. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the essential features of MAM techniques based on the most recent scientific knowledge. It explores emerging research on four of the most significant technologies, including material extrusion (ME), binder jetting (BJ), powder bed fusion (PBF), and directed energy deposition (DED). As well as providing an outline of fundamental process characteristics, ongoing efforts to optimize them and current challenges, it also highlights gaps in understanding and future research and development needs. A significant feature of this review is the provision of substantial documentation regarding the mechanical properties of materials processed by a variety of commercial systems, including a variety of novel hybrid additive manufacturing (HAM) machines. This is accompanied by an investigation into the most recent works done to characterize the environmental impact along with a conceptual framework for improving the energy efficiency (EE) of the manufacturing process. As a result of reporting on both the characteristics of several MAM processes along with their sustainability features in one integrated article, it is anticipated that this information will serve as a valuable resource for both the academic and manufacturing communities to better appreciate and understand what differentiates MAM from traditional manufacturing (TM) processes, thus facilitating its future advancement and adoption.}

  abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) field is rapidly expanding, attracting significant scientific attention. This family of processes will be widely used in the evolution of Industry 4.0, particularly in the production of customized components. However, as the complexity and variability of additive manufacturing processes increase, there is an increasing need for advanced techniques to ensure quality control, optimize performance, and reduce production costs. Multiple tests are required to optimize processing variables for specific equipment and processes, to achieve optimum processing conditions. The application of digital twins (DTs) has significantly enhanced the field of additive manufacturing. A digital twin, abbreviated as DT, refers to a computer-generated model that accurately depicts a real-world object, system, or process. A DT comprises the complete additive manufacturing process, from the initial conception phase to the final manufacturing phase. It enables the manufacturing process to be continuously monitored, studied, and optimized in real time. DT has emerged as an important tool in the additive manufacturing industry. They allow manufacturers to enhance the process, improve product quality, decrease costs, and accelerate innovation. However, the development of DT in AM is an iterative and continuous process. It requires collaboration between domain experts, data scientists, engineers, and manufacturing teams to guarantee an accurate representation of the process by the digital twin. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of DT for additive manufacturing, examining their applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions.},

  abstract = {Early detection of defects, such as keyhole pores and cracks is crucial in laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) additive manufacturing (AM) to prevent build failures. However, the complex melt pool behaviour cannot be adequately captured by conventional single-modal process monitoring approaches. This study introduces a multisensor fusion-based digital twin (MFDT) for localized quality prediction in the robotic L-DED process. The data used in multisensor fusion includes features extracted from a coaxial melt pool vision camera, a microphone, and an off-axis short wavelength infrared thermal camera. The key novelty of this work is a spatiotemporal data fusion method that synchronizes multisensor features with the real-time robot motion data to achieve localized quality prediction. Optical microscope (OM) images of the printed part are used to locate defect-free and defective regions (i.e., cracks and keyhole pores), which serve as ground truth labels for training supervised machine learning (ML) models for quality prediction. The trained ML model is then used to generate a virtual quality map that registers quality prediction outcomes within the 3D volume of the printed part, thus eliminating the need of physical inspections by destructive methods. Experiments show that the virtual quality map closely matches the actual quality observed by OM. Compared to traditional single-sensor-based quality prediction, the MFDT has achieved a significantly higher quality prediction accuracy (96\%), a higher ROC-AUC score (99\%), and a lower false alarm rate (4.4\%). As a result, the MFDT is a more reliable method for defect prediction. The proposed MFDT also lays the groundwork for our future development of a self-adaptive hybrid processing strategy that combines machining with AM for defect removal and quality improvement.},

  abstract = {Digital Twin -- a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making -- combined with recent advances in machine learning, offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\%--30\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to Proportional--Integral--Derivative (PID) controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.},

It has revealed some advantages over traditional manufacturing methods with this technology. With the advancement of information technologies, new approaches focusing on cost and improvement have begun to be adopted in the manufacturing industry. One such method is digital twin technology. A digital twin is frequently referred to as a digital replication of a physical system. Digital twins provide data and models to support the operation of design and manufacturing processes, as well as troubleshooting, diagnostics, and problem-solving. Various sensors are required to monitor the status of physical systems and transfer data to digital systems. Some of these Internet of Things-compatible sensors are already in production machines, but others can be added later. In the study, an Internet of Things-based system was proposed for the creation of digital twins using a virtual environment, and a digital twin simulation was created in order to bring the benefits of digitalization to production systems. The digital twin is modeled in the Matlab Simulink environment to perform binary classification to detect abnormal physical conditions that have the potential to disrupt the operation of the additive manufacturing machine and affect the quality of the manufacturing part. By generating a digital twin from real machine data, the proposed system will be able to detect errors.            ,               Eklemeli İmalat teknolojisi, imalat sanayine farklı bir yön veren teknolojilerdendir.

  abstract = {Abstract             The digital twin (DT) is a relatively new concept that is finding increased acceptance in industry. A DT is generally considered as comprising a physical entity, its virtual replica, and two-way digital data communications in-between. Its primary purpose is to leverage the process intelligence captured within digital models---or usually their faster-solving surrogates---towards generating increased value from the physical entities. The surrogate models are created using machine learning based on data obtained from the field, experiments and digital models, which may be physics-based or statistics-based. Anomaly detection and correction, and diagnostic closed-loop process control are examples of how a process DT can be deployed. In the manufacturing industry, its use can achieve improvements in product quality and process productivity. Metal additive manufacturing (AM) stands to gain tremendously from the use of DTs. This is because the AM process is inherently chaotic, resulting in poor repeatability. However, a DT acting in a supervisory role can inject certainty into the process by actively keeping it within bounds through real-time control commands. Closed-loop feedforward control is achieved by observing the process through sensors that monitor critical parameters and, if there are any deviations from their respective optimal ranges, suitable corrective actions are triggered. The type of corrective action (e.g. a change in laser power or a modification to the scanning speed) and its magnitude are determined by interrogating the surrogate models. Because of their artificial intelligence (AI)-endowed predictive capabilities, which allow them to foresee a future state of the physical twin (e.g. the AM process), DTs proactively take context-sensitive preventative steps, whereas traditional closed-loop feedback control is usually reactive. Apart from assisting a build process in real-time, a DT can help with planning the build of a part by pinpointing the optimum processing window relevant to the desired outcome. Again, the surrogate models are consulted to obtain the required information. In this article, we explain how the application of DTs to the metal AM process can significantly widen its application space by making the process more repeatable (through quality assurance) and cheaper (by getting builds right the first time).}

Especially for Laser-Directed Energy Deposition (DED-L), the extreme physical environment at the melt pool results in the need for multiple trial-and-error tests to quantify the process behavior. These tests significantly raise manufacturing expenses. A Digital Twin (DT) of the DED-L process can therefore be of substantial value if the amount of experimental testing is hereby reduced. In the present study, a multiscale DT based on coupling a global and local model has been investigated. The global model simulates the heating of the entire part, whereas the local model represents only a specific region of this global geometry. Using a high-density mesh for the local model enables the simulation of the specific laser-powder interactions and fast-cooling rates typical in DED-L. The results of the global model are used to integrate context awareness about the changing process conditions during the print job into the local model. This process evolvement is impossible to obtain with models of smaller dimensions and is of elemental necessity for accurately simulating multi-clad depositions. The DT was validated on an industrial-grade DED-L machine with in-situ process monitoring capabilities. In all cases, the DT shows a high resemblance with the experimental data and metallographic inspections at a reasonable computational cost.},

  abstract = {Laser directed-energy deposition (DED) offers notable advantages in additive manufacturing (AM) for producing intricate geometries and facilitating material functional grading. However, inherent challenges such as material property inconsistencies and part variability persist, predominantly due to its layer-wise fabrication approach. Critical to these challenges is heat accumulation during DED, influencing the resultant material microstructure and properties. Although closed-loop control methods for managing heat accumulation and temperature regulation are prevalent in DED literature, few approaches integrate real-time monitoring, physics-based modeling, and control simultaneously in a cohesive framework. To address this, we present a digital twin (DT) framework for real-time model predictive control of process parameters of the DED for achieving a specific process design objective. To enable its implementation, we detail the development of a surrogate model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based machine learning which uses Bayesian Inference to predict temperatures across various spatial locations of the DED-built part. This model offers real-time predictions of future temperature states. In addition, we introduce a Bayesian Optimization (BO) method for Time Series Process Optimization (BOTSPO). Its foundational principles align with traditional BO, and its novelty lies in our unique time series process profile generator with a reduced dimensional representation. BOTSPO is used for dynamic process optimization in which we deploy BOTSPO to determine the optimal laser power profile, aiming to achieve desired mechanical properties in a DED build. The identified profile establishes a process trajectory that online process optimizations aim to match or exceed in performance. This paper elucidates components of the digital twin framework, advocating its prospective consolidation into a comprehensive digital twin system for AM.},

  abstract = {This study demonstrates the significant effect of the recoil pressure and Marangoni convection in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of 316L stainless steel. A three-dimensional high fidelity powder-scale model reveals how the strong dynamical melt flow generates pore defects, material spattering (sparking), and denudation zones. The melt track is divided into three sections: a topological depression, a transition and a tail region, each being the location of specific physical effects. The inclusion of laser ray-tracing energy deposition in the powder-scale model improves over traditional volumetric energy deposition. It enables partial particle melting, which impacts pore defects in the denudation zone. Different pore formation mechanisms are observed at the edge of a scan track, at the melt pool bottom (during collapse of the pool depression), and at the end of the melt track (during laser power ramp down). Remedies to these undesirable pores are discussed. The results are validated against the experiments and the sensitivity to laser absorptivity is discussed.},

  abstract = {A digital twin (DT), with the components of a physics-based model, a data-driven model, and a machine learning (ML) enabled efficient surrogate model, behaves as a virtual twin of the real-world physical process. In terms of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) based additive manufacturing (AM), a DT can predict the current and future states of the melt pool and the resulting defects corresponding to the input laser parameters, evolve itself by assimilating in-situ sensor data, and optimize the laser parameters to mitigate defect formation. In this paper, we present a deep neural operator enabled DT framework for closed-loop feedback control of the L-PBF process. This is accomplished by building a physics-based computational model to accurately represent the melt pool states, an efficient Fourier neural operator (FNO) based surrogate model to approximate the melt pool solution field, followed by a physics-based procedure to extract information from the computed melt pool simulation that can further be correlated to the defect quantities of interest (e.g., surface roughness). An optimization algorithm is then exercised to control laser input and minimize defects. On the other hand, the constructed DT also evolves with the physical twin via offline finetuning and online material calibration. For instance, the probabilistic distribution of laser absorptivity can be updated to match the real-time captured thermal image data. Finally, a probabilistic framework is adopted for uncertainty quantification. The developed DT is envisioned to guide the AM process and facilitate high-quality manufacturing in L-PBF-based metal AM.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The purpose of this research is to enhance the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing technique by addressing its susceptibility to defects, specifically lack of fusion. The primary goal is to optimize the LPBF process using a digital twin (DT) approach, integrating physics-based modeling and machine learning to predict the lack of fusion.                                         Design/methodology/approach               This research uses finite element modeling to simulate the physics of LPBF for an AISI 316L stainless steel alloy. Various process parameters are systematically varied to generate a comprehensive data set that captures the relationship between factors such as power and scan speed and the quality of fusion. A novel DT architecture is proposed, combining a classification model (recurrent neural network) with reinforcement learning. This DT model leverages real-time sensor data to predict the lack of fusion and adjusts process parameters through the reinforcement learning system, ensuring the system remains within a controllable zone.                                         Findings               This study's findings reveal that the proposed DT approach successfully predicts and mitigates the lack of fusion in the LPBF process. By using a combination of physics-based modeling and machine learning, the research establishes an efficient framework for optimizing fusion in metal LPBF processes. The DT's ability to adapt and control parameters in real time, guided by machine learning predictions, provides a promising solution to the challenges associated with lack of fusion, potentially overcoming the traditional and costly trial-and-error experimental approach.                                         Originality/value               Originality lies in the development of a novel DT architecture that integrates physics-based modeling with machine learning techniques, specifically a recurrent neural network and reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {The customized production of complex components by 3D printing has been hailed as a potentially transformative tool in manufacturing with important applications in health care, automotive and aerospace industries. However, after about a quarter of a century of research and development, only a handful of commercial alloys can be printed and the market value of all 3D printed products now amounts to a negligible portion of the manufacturing economy. This difficulty is attributable to a remarkable diversity in structure and properties of the printed components and susceptibility to defects. In addition, the current practice of qualifying components by prolonged trial and error with expensive printing equipment and feed stock material confine the printed products to a niche market where the high product cost and the delay in the qualification are not critical factors. Here we explain how a digital twin or a digital replica of the printing machine will reduce the number of trial and error tests to obtain desired product attributes and reduce the time required for part qualification to make the printed components cost effective. It is shown that a comprehensive digital twin of 3D printing machine consisting of mechanistic, control and statistical models of 3D printing, machine learning and big data can reduce the volume of trial and error testing, reduce defects and shorten time between the design and production.},

  abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes enable their deployment in broad applications from aerospace to art, design, and architecture. Part quality and performance are the main concerns during AM processes execution that the achievement of adequate characteristics can be guaranteed, considering a wide range of influencing factors, such as process parameters, material, environment, measurement, and operators training. Investigating the effects of not only the influential AM processes variables but also their interactions and coupled impacts are essential to process optimization which requires huge efforts to be made. Therefore, numerical simulation can be an effective tool that facilities the evaluation of the AM processes principles. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is a widespread Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM process that due to its superior advantages, such as capability to print complex and highly customized components, which leads to an increasing attention paid by industries and academia. Temperature distribution and melt pool dynamics have paramount importance to be well simulated and correlated by part quality in terms of surface finish, induced residual stress and microstructure evolution during SLM. Summarizing numerical simulations of SLM in this survey is pointed out as one important research perspective as well as exploring the contribution of adopted approaches and practices. This review survey has been organized to give an overview of AM processes such as extrusion, photopolymerization, material jetting, laminated object manufacturing, and powder bed fusion. And in particular is targeted to discuss the conducted numerical simulation of SLM to illustrate a uniform picture of existing nonproprietary approaches to predict the heat transfer, melt pool behavior, microstructure and residual stresses analysis.},

Given the increasing complexity and volume of literature in this domain, conventional review methods are becoming insufficient. To address this challenge, the study applies a novel approach named retrieval augmented generation. This is a technique that combines large language models with real-time information retrieval, enabling the automated identification and summarization of typologies across a broad corpus of publications. A total of 1,354 publications were initially screened, leading to 144 distinct categorizations relevant to digital twins in industrial contexts. The resulting taxonomy classifies digital twins along multiple dimensions, including life cycle stages, physical domain and hierarchy levels, model characteristics, digital thread connectivity and deployment strategies. This work provides both researchers and practitioners with a structured approach to understanding and implementing digital twins in manufacturing environments, as well as a guideline to completely describe a specific implementation. The taxonomy serves as a foundation for future research and as a practical tool for industrial applications, since it defines design decisions, which have to be made.},

Conceptually, a DT mimics the state of its physical twin in real time and vice versa. Application of DT includes real-time monitoring, designing/planning, optimization, maintenance, remote access, etc. Its implementation is expected to grow exponentially in the coming decades. The advent of Industry 4.0 has brought complex industrial systems that are more autonomous, smart, and highly interconnected. These systems generate considerable amounts of data useful for several applications such as improving performance, predictive maintenance, training, etc. A sudden influx in the number of publications related to ‘Digital Twin’ has led to confusion between different terminologies related to the digitalization of industries. Another problem that has arisen due to the growing popularity of DT is a lack of consensus on the description of DT as well as so many different types of DT, which adds to the confusion. This paper intends to consolidate the different types of DT and different definitions of DT throughout the literature for easy identification of DT from the rest of the complimentary terms such as ‘product avatar’, ‘digital thread’, ‘digital model’, and ‘digital shadow’. The paper looks at the concept of DT since its inception to its predicted future to realize the value it can bring to certain sectors. Understanding the characteristics and types of DT while weighing its pros and cons is essential for any researcher, business, or sector before investing in the technology.}

The principal goal of this study is to highlight the aspects of DF and its development using existing techniques.A comprehensive literature review finds a substantial lack of complete techniques that incorporate cyber-physical systems, advanced data analytics, AI, standardized interoperability, human--machine cooperation and scalable adaptability. The suggested DF effectively fills this void by integrating cyber-physical system components, including DT, AM, SM and sensors into the manufacturing process. Using sophisticated data analytics and AI algorithms, the DF facilitates real-time data analysis, predictive maintenance, quality control and optimal resource allocation. In addition, the suggested DF ensures interoperability between diverse devices and systems by emphasizing standardized communication protocols and interfaces. The modular and adaptable architecture of the DF enables scalability and adaptation, allowing for rapid reaction to market conditions.Based on the need of DF, this review presents a comprehensive approach to DF development using DTs, sensing devices, LAM and SM processes and provides current progress in this domain.}

We analyzed 65 studies to identify the types of printers used, challenges and opportunities, methodologies, implementation approach, quality assurance, process optimization, integration of material behavior, and structural analysis. The results outline the challenges associated with data collection and processing due to real-time requirements or generating relevant data through sensors.

The wide scope of work already done has focused on the effects of process parameters such as laser power, hatch spacing, scan speed and strategy, and layer thickness on the final part’s properties. However, the characteristics of the actual powder should also be considered. The particles’ size, morphology, roughness, and chemical composition will affect the final part properties including surface texture, density, tensile strength, and hardness. This paper will share some of the measurement methods used at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to better understand metal powder for additive manufacturing. These include the striation/separation in transportation and handling, sampling procedures, and the actual spreading of powder in the laser powder bed fusion process. Results are presented that illustrate variations in the particle size distribution as a function of location on the build platform, substrate/part surface condition, and vertical position.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing defect in carbon fiber reinforced polymers pose a major challenge to clarification of the weakening mechanism, duo to their various types, shapes, and multi-scale characteristics. In this study, a three-dimensional computed tomography was utilized to create void’s model and then conducts multi-scale analysis using the homogenization method. In details, a mesoscopic model is developed by millimeter-scale voids, where the material properties derived from homogenization calculations of a micro-scale model containing voids, fibers, and resins. Comparing against theoretical calculations and conventional representative volume element methods demonstrates that the proposed multi-scale approach offers higher accuracy in predicting the mechanical behavior of carbon fiber reinforced polymers with voids (the error within 5\% of experimental results). Additionally, a significant direction-dependent modulus weakening mechanism caused by voids was revealed, which is determined by distribution laws and morphology of voids, can provide valuable insights for designing and evaluating carbon fiber reinforced polymers structures.},

  abstract = {With the development of Industry 4.0, additive manufacturing will be widely used to produce customized components. However, it is rather time-consuming and expensive to produce components with sound structure and good mechanical properties using additive manufacturing by a trial-and-error approach. To obtain optimal process conditions, numerous experiments are needed to optimize the process variables within given machines and processes. Digital twins (DT) are defined as a digital representation of a production system or service or just an active unique product characterized by certain properties or conditions. They are the potential solution to assist in overcoming many issues in additive manufacturing, in order to improve part quality and shorten the time to qualify products. The DT system could be very helpful to understand, analyze and improve the product, service system or production. However, the development of genuine DT is still impeded due to lots of factors, such as the lack of a thorough understanding of the DT concept, framework, and development methods. Moreover, the linkage between existing brownfield systems and their data are under development. This paper aims to summarize the current status and issues in DT for additive manufacturing, in order to provide more references for subsequent research on DT systems.},

  abstract = {Biomass‐based hydrogel is a promising flame‐retardant material and has a high potential for applications in transportation, aerospace, building and electrical engineering, and electronics. However, rapid vat photopolymerization (VP) 3D printing of biomass‐based hydrogels, especially that of all‐natural ones, is still rare. Herein, a new class of VP 3D‐printed hydrogels with strong covalent networks, fabricating using fully biomass materials and a commercial liquid crystal display (LCD) printer assembled with low‐intensity visible light is presented. Encouragingly, the highly ordered layer‐by‐layer packing structures provided by VP 3D printing technology endow these hydrogels with remarkable flame retardancy, exceptional temperature resistance, advantageous combustion behaviors, and favorable mechanical strength, in particular, giving them a better limit oxygen index (83.5\%) than various biomass‐based hydrogels. The proposed approach enables the green design as well as the precise and efficient preparation for flame‐retardant materials, paving the way for the future flame‐retardant materials toward attaining green sustainability.}
